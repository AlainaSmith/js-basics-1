// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

1. Planning 
2. Analysis of Requirements
3. Design
4. Implementation
5. Testing and Integration
6. Maintain 


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle 
    and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
*/

let planning = 'This is when the goal of the software is determined and defined.'
let analysisOfRequirements = "This is the process of determinig user expectations for a new product. this focuses on the tasks that determine the conditions needed to alter a product."
let Design = 'This phase transforms all the requirements into complete, detailed system design specifications.'
let implementation = 'This phase gets everything rolling! It puts the plan into action in order to accomplish the objectives.'
let testingAndIntegration = 'This phase tests all the plans that have been initiated, it tests the software systems performance, functionality and reliability.'
let maintain = 'This phase continuously occurs after the software becomes operational. It upgrades, repairs, and fixes the software if something happens.'
